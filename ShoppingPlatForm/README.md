# 🛒 Shopverse — Our E-Commerce Web App

Hey there! Welcome to **Shopverse**. 

We are a group of four 18-year-old college friends who wanted to build a clean, modern, and fully working luxury e-commerce store from scratch. We wanted smooth animations, real product filters, working carts, and a live database instead of just static mockups.
